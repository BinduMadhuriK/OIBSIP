# TASK 2 - UNEMPLOYMENT ANALYSIS WITH PYTHON

## Task Description
- Unemployment is measured by the unemployment rate which is the number of people who are unemployed as a percentage of the total labour force. 
- We have seen a sharp increase in the unemployment rate during Covid-19, so analyzing the unemployment rate can be a good data science project. 

## About the Dataset
The provided ```**Unemployment in India.csv**``` Dataset delves into the unemployment landscape across diverse states in India. The story behind this dataset is how lock-down affects employment opportunities and how the unemployment rate increases during the Covid-19 for different states in India for last one year. Within the dataset, vital indicators including State-wise breakdown, timeline, measurement frequency, Estimated Unemployment Rate (%), Estimated Employed Individuals, Estimated Labour Participation Rate (%) and Area are encompassed. These columns are briefed as follows:
- Region: Various states constituting the Indian subcontinent.
- Date: The specific dates of unemployment rate recordings.
- Frequency: The regularity of measurement collection (Monthly).
- Estimated Unemployment Rate (%): The proportion of unemployed individuals in each Indian state.
- Estimated Employed Individuals: The tally of presently engaged individuals.
- Estimated Labour Participation Rate (%): The percentage of the working-age populace (16-64 years) actively involved in the job market, including both employed individuals and those actively seeking jobs.
- Area: Employment and unemployment rates in Urban and rural areas.

## Problem Statement
Unemployment, a critical economic indicator, is typically quantified using the unemployment rate, which represents the proportion of individuals without employment within the total labor force. The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted the global labor market, resulting in a substantial surge in the unemployment rate. Analyzing and comprehending the dynamics of this economic metric through data science can offer valuable insights and potential solutions.

## Objective
- The primary goal of this project is to perform a comprehensive analysis of unemployment using Python. This analysis aims to shed light on the factors contributing to changes in the unemployment rate, identify patterns, and generate actionable recommendations to address unemployment challenges.
- The analysis aims to provide insights into the pandemic's socio-economic effects on India's workforce and labor arena.

## Project Details
- Unemployment Rate: The primary focus is on understanding the unemployment rate, which serves as an essential economic indicator.
- COVID-19 Impact: Given the profound effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, the analysis will pay particular attention to the pandemic's role in unemployment rate fluctuations.
- Data Analysis: Python will be the primary tool for data analysis, enabling the exploration of unemployment data, the identification of correlations with other economic indicators, and the visualization of trends.
- Recommendations: The project will conclude by providing actionable recommendations or insights that can guide policy-making, labor market interventions, or economic recovery strategies.

This project holds significant importance, as addressing unemployment challenges and understanding their causes is crucial for policymakers, governments, and organizations in fostering economic recovery and ensuring the well-being of individuals within the labor force.

## Conclusion
In this data science project, we embarked on a comprehensive analysis of the unemployment rate, a critical economic indicator, with a particular focus on the unprecedented challenges brought about by the Covid-19 pandemic. Our exploratory data analysis yielded valuable insights that shed light on the dynamics of unemployment in India. 

1. We observed a significant surge in the Estimated Unemployment Rate during the Covid-19 lockdown, underscoring the profound impact of the pandemic on the labor market.

2. Our state-wise analysis highlighted the states that bore the brunt of this crisis. Puducherry and Jharkhand stood out with the highest Estimated Unemployment Rates during the lockdown, while Haryana and Tripura held the top positions before the pandemic.

3. The transition from pre-lockdown to lockdown was marked by shifts in the states with the highest Estimated Unemployment Rates. Tripura, Haryana, and Himachal Pradesh led the rankings before the lockdown, whereas Puducherry, Jharkhand, and Bihar claimed the top spots during the lockdown.

4. Notably, states like Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, and West Bengal exhibited consistent challenges in maintaining high levels of Estimated Employed Workforce both before and during the lockdown.

5. Our analysis of Estimated Labour Participation Rate identified states that showed resilience in labor force participation. Telangana, Tripura, Meghalaya, and Assam topped the list before the lockdown, while Meghalaya, Telangana, Tripura, and Andhra Pradesh excelled during the lockdown.

6. We uncovered a robust negative correlation between Estimated Unemployment Rate and Estimated Employed, highlighting the intricate relationship between these two crucial employment indicators, both before and during the lockdown.

This project not only provided valuable insights into the economic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic but also demonstrated the power of data science in understanding and addressing complex socio-economic challenges. The findings contribute to informed decision-making and policy formulation, and underscore the importance of data-driven approaches in mitigating the effects of future crises.
