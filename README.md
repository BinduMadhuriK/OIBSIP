## TASK 1

- Project: **IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION**
- Description: Iris flower has three species - setosa, versicolor, and virginica, which differs according to their measurements. Now assume that we have the measurements of the iris flowers according to their species, and here the task is to train a machine learning model that can learn from the measurements of the iris species and classify them. 
- Dataset Provided: The Scikit-learn library provides the dataset for iris flower classification. The same dataset [link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saurabh00007/iriscsv) is shared for the task of iris flower classification with Machine Learning.
- Libraries used: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, pickle, sklearn, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, K-Neighbors, Naïve Bayes, SVC.
- Models used: Decision Tree, K-Neighbors, Naïve Bayes, SVC
- Repository: The project's GitHub repository can be found at [TASK 1]().
